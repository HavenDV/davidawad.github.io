Much of human history is a story of conflict due to scarcity, from food to land and shelter. The scarcity-defining resource of the industrial world was capital. I believe the scarcity-defining resources of the digital age are data and attention. I want to do everything I can to help lawmakers meet the challenge of the new era.

I've been fortunate to build a track record of bi-partisan policy issues with various think tanks, government agencies, trade organizations, legislators, and campaigns on topics ranging from local broadband internet access, high-skilled immigration, and wireless spectrum auctions to cybersecurity, data property rights, venture economic impact by regulatory changes, and more.


### Organizations I'm working with:

There has been some fascinating work with the IEEE [Artificial Intelligence & Autonomous Systems Policy Committee (AI&ASPC)](https://ieeeusa.org/volunteers/committees/aiaspc/) that I'm a part of on self-driving car safety regulations, the role of machine learning in the justice system along with other issues. I'm also a member of policy committees at the [ACM on Law and Intellectual Property](https://www.acm.org/public-policy/ustpc) as well as the [National Space Society](https://space.nss.org/nss-policy-committee/).

The house of representatives [Modernization Staff Association](https://twitter.com/msa_caphill) run by [Ananda Bhatia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ananda-bhatia/) (for Seth Moulton in MA-6) has some digital projects I've helped coordinate along with [Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org/) to make it easier for congress to automate and deal with some of their newfound digital challenges since 2020.

I occassionally review proposed technology legislation with the [New Hampshire Liberty Alliance](https://www.nhliberty.org/) and cooperate with members of the New Hampshire legislature.
