# Sponsoring ://ideas

This is a weekly newsletter where I share what's interesting in the world of crypto, tech, and investing. The audience tends to be a wide range of people who are very likely to engage with content that's potentially useful to them.


|---|---|
| Active Subscribers  | 100  |
| Email Open Rate  | x% |
| Email Click Rate  | x% |
| Yearly Subscriber Retention  | x% |
| Newsletter Frequency  | Weekly (sundays or mondays) |
| Sponsorship Slots | One Slot per Issue |


### Sponsorship Format

I maintain a sponsorship slot at the bottom of the email for any given link.


For a sponsorship, the copy is flexible. You can use links, bold text, italics, and lists, but not images. I'd suggest keeping it under 150 words for your own success, but it's up to you.

If you purchase a sponsorship slot in my newsletter, I will tweet about your company when the newsletter goes out thanking you. That can also include your preferred copy and link.

I would only accept sponsorships from companies and products I actually believe in. If I think what your company does is exploitative, unethical, illegal, or excessively lame, then you probably don't have the money to force me to share it.


### Make a booking

If this sounds useful to you, [just email me](mailto:{{site.links.email}}?subject=Looking to sponsor ://ideas!&body=Please include some information about your company and your goals. Thank you again for considering a sponsorship.). I'd be happy to find an arrangement that works.
