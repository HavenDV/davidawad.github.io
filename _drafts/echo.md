### Does machine learning justify changing our need for a glass box?

<span style="font-family: 3em">T</span>ake a look at this paper. It’s titled, “Deep learning and the Schrödinger equation”. It’s implications are really interesting; first let’s take a look at the paper’s claim.

        Now we don’t need to understand a problem in order to be able to use an approximation of the answer.

### Which models are better?

Well just looking at it heuristically we get exact accuracy with glass boxes but they can take a long time to develop and accurately research.
